          <h2>Message from the Author</h2>
          <p>Symphony of Evolution is a quarto-sized, 442-page book dealing with the birth
of life and the evolution of humans.<br/>
The 10-chapter book starts with the Big Bang and the birth of the Universe. It then
continues with the birth of the Milky Way, the Solar System and the Planet Earth.<br/>
The title of this first chapter is “Birth of the Earth”.<br/>
Chapter two, titled “Birth of Life”, deals with the formation of the Moon, the Earth’s
oceans and life itself.<br/>
Chapters three to nine, dealing respectively with the birth of animals, chordates,
tetrapods, mammals, primates, homos and homo sapiens, explain in detail how
life forms evolved; how the first cell evolved into animals and how a certain line
of animals finally evolved into humans.<br/>
The important thing about these chapters is that the evolutionary line that evolved
into human beings is explained in an uninterrupted, linear manner.<br/>
The final chapter explains how humans conquered the World.<br/>
Currently, the book is available only in Persian; but an English translation will be
published in due time.</p>
